# ALICA Interfaces

- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LEB-EPFL/ALICA_interfaces.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LEB-EPFL/ALICA_interfaces)

This package contains the interface definitions for the primary
components of [ALICA](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/ALICA), the
automatic illumination control package for light microscopy. It is a
compile-time dependency of ALICA.

## Relationship with ALICA and SASS

![](src/main/resources/diagram.png)

These interfaces are maintained separately of ALICA and
[SASS](https://github.com/LEB-EPFL/SASS) because they are not expected
to change frequently and should be quite stable.
